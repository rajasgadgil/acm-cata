The product recommendations plugin automatically generates related products and shows products based on purchase history. Users can use the plugin to cross sell products and create various product categories as well as a database of related products. 

Customize how your product recommendations show in your post by using a simple shortcode. The product recommendation is shown as a widget that includes several related products as images or text, linked to the product page on your WordPress site or an external site. Each term associated with the product within the post can be linked to the product page.
