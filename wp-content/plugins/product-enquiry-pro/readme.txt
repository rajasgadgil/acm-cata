A. Go to the Product Enquiry settings in the dashboard. Under ‘Form Options’, check the option 'Enable Telephone Number Field' to show a field to input the telephone number.

2. How do I style the Enquiry Dialog?
A. The ‘Product Enquiry’ settings menu in your dashboard, provides you options to set the colors for the Enquiry Dialog and the Enquiry Button, under 'Styling Options'. You can change the dialog background color, text color, button colors, and even set the product name to a different color.

3. Can I set multiple email ids in the Recipient’s field?

4. How can I filter the enquiry records in the Dashboard?
A. In the ‘Enquiry Details’ menu, there is a search box ‘Search’. Enter a value in this box, to filter the enquiry records based on that value. For example, if you want to view the records for your product named PN781, you would have to enter PN781 in the search box.

5. How to export the enquiry records?
A. In the ‘Enquiry Details’ menu, there is an ‘Export As CSV’ button. Use this button to export the enquiry records. By default all records will be exported. To export selective records, filter the records using the ‘Search’ box, or check individual records to be exported, using the checkbox, and then click on the ‘Export As CSV’ button.

8. Help! I lost my license key?
A. In case you have misplaced your purchased product license key, kindly go back and retrieve your purchase receipt id from your mailbox. Use this receipt id to make a support request to retrieve your license key.

9. How do I contact you for support?
A. You can direct your support request to us, using the Support form.

10. What will happen if my license expires?
Every purchased license is valid for one year from the date of purchase. During this time you will recieve free updates and support. If the license expires, you will still be able to use PEP, but you will not recieve any support or updates.

11. Do you have a refund policy?
Yes. Refunds will be provided under the following conditions: 
-If PEP does not work with your theme and has integration issues, which we are unable to fix, even after support requests have been made. How to raise a support request.
-Refund is requested within 30 days of the original product purchase date.
-Refund will not be provided, if you do not have a valid reason, to not use the product.

12. Can I disable PEP for specific product?
A. Yes, it is possible to disable for PEP for specific product. This feature is available from 1.3.1 onwards. To do that, please go to the Add/Edit Screen of corresponding product. Search for 'Disable Enquiry for this Product' field. It is above the 'Publish'  or 'Update' button. Setting that dropdown to 'Yes' will prevent PEP from displaying Enquiry form on that product page.

13. I can not see 'Enquiry Form' link on a product. What should I do?
A. This can happen in three scenarios:
     a)  Your license is not activated. 
     b)  PEP has been disabled from settings page of 'Product Enquiry'
     c)  PEP has been disabled for specific product from 'Edit Product' screen.

14. How can I change the Subject and Content of email that goes out to the Admin?
A. Though there is no option in Product Enquiry's settings page to change the email content, PEP allows to do that via coding. One can write a code on the filter 'pep_admin_email_content' and 'pep_admin_email_subject'

15. Is it possible to change the Subject and Content of email that goes to out to the Customer?
A. Yes, it is possible to do that. It can be done using filters: pep_customer_email_subject and pep_customer_email_content

16. I want to add my own styling to the Enquiry or Quote Request button that appears on frontend. How should I do that?
A. On PEP's settings page, we have provided different options, so that you can design the button as per you want. If those options are not sufficient, then you can add your own css in 'Add Custom CSS' box on the settings page.

17. How to disable Product Enquiry forms for products of specific categories?
A. To achieve this, you can add your code on the filter 'pep_before_deciding_position_of_enquiry_form'. Returning false from the associated function with that filter will prevent PEP from showing the button on frontend.
 
18. I am not able to export enquiries/I encounter a white screen when I export enquiries.
A. This could be because WP_DEBUG has been turned on and you are notified with warnings by some other activated plugin or theme.

19. I generated a Quote PDF hours ago. I cannot find it now. What should I do?
A. Clicking the ‘Save and Preview’ button will generate the PDF once again. QuoteUp automatically deletes generated PDFs after an hour of creation, to protect your data in case your server gets compromised and to save space.

20. I feel it takes time to generate PDF. Do you know why so?
A. When ‘Save and Preview’ button is clicked for the first time after installing a plugin, it downloads a font required for your site and then generates a PDF. Time taken to download the font depends upon the size of a font.

21. I had disabled price for all products then to price is visible on products page?
A. when you disable or enable price for all products make sure you check global settings to apply those changes on all products.
